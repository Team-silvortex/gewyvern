# Leselang Documentation Module

Owns the independent embeddable control language, its compiler boundary, effect model,
capability checks, continuation format, and deterministic re-entry semantics.

Leserpent is the first reference host, not the language's required runtime.
The intended core is a hostable Rust crate plus a narrow protocol/FFI surface
for other languages. GUI automation is one host profile; a shell for nuis OS
and sirius kernel is a distant host profile, not an implemented capability.
No GUI framework is automatically compatible; each one needs a developer-owned
adapter or generated framework binding against the Leselang UI protocol. The
`UiAdapterManifest` is the shared proof for that binding.

## Start

1. [First GUI automation tutorial](../book/tutorial-leselang-gui-automation.md)
2. [Current language contract](../leselang-language.md)
3. [Renderer-neutral UI IR contract](../leselang-ui.md)
4. [Leserpent 2.0 architecture](../leserpent-2-architecture.md)
5. [Gate-based delivery roadmap](../leserpent-2-roadmap.md)
6. [Sequential control flow and remaining script-language gaps](../leselang-control-flow.md)
7. [Independent embedding architecture and extraction gates](../leselang-embedding.md)

## Contracts

- [Domain and protocol compatibility](../../crates/leserpent-protocol/COMPATIBILITY.md)
- [Project status tensor](../project-status-system.md)
- [GewyLang module](gewylang.md)

Leselang and GewyLang are separate languages. GewyLang defines protocol
behavior; Leselang controls explicitly adapted hosts, including Leserpent
orchestration and UI functions today. Full runtime independence remains a
tracked target, not a completed property of every Leselang crate.
