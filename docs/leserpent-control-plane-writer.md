# Leserpent control-plane writer

Leserpent's transitional JSON control plane is single-writer across processes.
This is a cold-takeover reliability contract, not an active-active claim.

## Admission

At startup, each host competes for an owner-private, non-symlink process lease
derived from the canonical control-state path. The lease binds process ID,
stable process-start identity, and a random owner token. Exactly one fresh
process becomes `owner`; every other process remains `standby` for its lifetime.

Authenticated writer health is available at:

```text
GET /v1/persistence/control-writer-health
```

The response reports `starting`, `owner`, `standby`, `lease_lost`, or `stopped`
without exposing paths, tokens, or raw errors.

## Mutation fence

The machine-readable route inventory is
`docs/contracts/leserpent-control-plane-mutations-v1.json`.

All non-read methods under `/v1` require writer ownership unless explicitly
listed as a read-only POST. The current sole exception is runtime registration
planning. Unknown future non-read routes fail closed.

The fence is deliberately redundant:

1. HTTP middleware rejects standby requests before validation, discovery, or
   external authority effects.
2. `RegistryService` checks ownership before in-memory, JSON, or SQLite
   mutation.
3. Persistence methods repeat the check as a final write backstop.
4. Runtime deletion recovery and checkpoint workers stay idle on standby and
   stop if ownership is lost.

A rejected HTTP mutation returns:

```json
{
  "error": "control_plane_writer_standby",
  "reason": "This leserpentd instance is read-only because another process owns the control-plane writer lease."
}
```

## Takeover

An already-loaded standby never promotes itself after the owner exits because
its compatibility projection may be stale. Operators or supervisors start a
fresh process, which validates the stale owner record, acquires the lease, and
reloads JSON and Orchestra state before accepting writes.

This contract does not provide hot failover, quorum consensus, or multi-writer
conflict resolution. Those belong in the Rust durable authority rather than the
transitional C# compatibility control plane.
