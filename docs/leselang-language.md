# Leselang Language Contract

This reference is the authoritative, model-oriented contract for the currently
implemented Leselang slice. The broader destination is defined by the
[Leserpent 2.0 architecture](leserpent-2-architecture.md); unimplemented roadmap
syntax is not part of this contract.

Status: **Gate 2, evolving contract 0.6.0**. The current vertical slice parses,
lowers, authorizes, suspends, serializes, restores, and resumes the read-only
`runtime.list` effect and the idempotent `runtime.refresh` command effect.

## Canonical Program

```leselang
fn main() = runtime.list(
  environment: "production",
  cluster: none,
  role: "edge"
)
```

`runtime.list` returns a runtime list and requires the `runtime.read`
capability. Each optional filter accepts a string or `none`; empty strings are
normalized to `none` during HIR lowering.

The canonical mutating program is:

```leselang
fn main() = runtime.refresh(runtime_id: "runtime-a")
```

`runtime.refresh` requires `runtime.refresh`, one valid `runtime_id`, and the
expected runtime revision supplied to `Vm::start`. The VM derives stable
`leselang-command-N` and `leselang-effect-N` identifiers from the continuation
sequence and persists the complete `CommandEnvelope` before dispatch.

## Grammar

```ebnf
program       = function, EOF ;
function      = "fn", identifier, "(", ")", "=", effect-call ;
effect-call   = identifier, ".", identifier, "(", [ arguments ], ")" ;
arguments     = argument, { ",", argument }, [ "," ] ;
argument      = identifier, ":", value ;
value         = string | "none" ;
identifier    = ( letter | "_" ), { letter | digit | "_" } ;
string        = '"', { character | escape }, '"' ;
escape        = "\\", ( '"' | "\\" | "n" | "r" | "t" ) ;
```

Whitespace and `//` line comments are retained as lossless tokens, including
their byte spans. Reassembling token text must reproduce the original source.
Source is UTF-8 and limited to 256 KiB.

The implemented surface deliberately excludes general expressions, local
bindings, arbitrary mutation, loops, concurrency syntax, raw HTTP, shell
execution, and host-language reflection. Synchronous source semantics do not expose
`async`/`await`.

## HIR And Authorization

The syntax tree lowers into typed `RuntimeList` or `RuntimeRefresh` effects. Lowering rejects
unknown effects, duplicate named arguments, unknown arguments, and values with
the wrong shape.

Authorization is explicit and occurs before VM execution. A caller without
the effect's required capability receives a capability diagnostic; the VM does not emit an
effect request for unauthorized code.

## Execution Protocol

The stackless VM advances through six protocol states:

- `Done`: evaluation completed with bounded output
- `Effect`: the host must execute a typed request and resume the continuation
- `Yield`: cooperative suspension reserved by the protocol
- `Cancelled`: terminal requested cancellation or trusted deadline expiry
- `Failed`: terminal classified effect failure or exhausted semantic retries
- `Fault`: evaluation stopped with a stable VM diagnostic

For the current slice, `start` emits one typed query or command operation. The
operation carries a continuation token and expected revision. Read-only queries
may use the direct embedded `resume` path. Mutating commands must be leased and
completed through `acknowledge_effect`; direct mutation resume fails closed.

`Vm::start_timed` accepts scheduler `now_ms` and a bounded timeout, persists the
resulting absolute deadline, and requires `resume_at`, `claim_effect`, or
`acknowledge_effect` to supply trusted scheduler time. At or after the deadline,
the VM atomically records `Cancelled(DeadlineExceeded)` before another dispatch
or result can win. `Vm::cancel_effect` records `Cancelled(Requested)` and may
fence an active lease. Both cancellation forms are durable, idempotently replayed
terminal states. The legacy `Vm::start` remains untimed for embedded compatibility.

Workers classify execution errors as `Transient` or `Permanent` through
`Vm::report_effect_error`. Permanent errors immediately become a durable
`Step::Failed`; transient errors follow a bounded `RetryPolicy`. The default is
three semantic retries with deterministic exponential delays starting at 250 ms
and capped at 30 seconds. Policy limits are 16 retries and one-hour delays.
`retry_count` is separate from transport `attempt`, so a worker crash does not
consume business retry budget. A scheduled retry persists its `ready_at_ms` and
last classified error and cannot be claimed early; retry exhaustion becomes a
typed, replayable failure. The original effect request and command idempotency
key never change.

Continuation images are versioned and capped at 64 KiB. Execution also enforces
a source-size limit, fuel limit, 24-hour maximum deadline budget, and
10,000-item output limit.
Restored continuations advance their token sequence so a restart cannot reuse a
live token.

`Vm::new` provides an ephemeral journal for tests and embedded one-shot use.
`Vm::open_journal` opens the SQLite effect journal for service operation. It
atomically persists pending continuations before exposing an effect, restores
them after restart, and commits the first terminal step as authoritative.
Duplicate or competing completion after a process restart replays that durable
step rather than accepting a later result. Sequence allocation is transactional
across concurrent VM connections.

Service workers use the durable dispatch outbox rather than dispatching the
returned `Step::Effect` directly. `Vm::claim_effect` leases one ready or expired
request and returns an attempt-fenced `DispatchLease`; another live VM cannot
claim it until that lease expires. `Vm::acknowledge_effect` verifies the request,
attempt, and expiration, then commits the terminal step and acknowledgement in
one transaction. A crashed worker therefore causes bounded redelivery, while a
late worker cannot overwrite a newer attempt. The `now_ms` argument is scheduler
time supplied by the trusted runtime host, never by a remote request.

The journal is schema-versioned. Schema 4 persists indexed absolute deadlines,
retry counts, and not-before clocks. Schema 1 and 2 records migrate as untimed,
and schema 1 through 3 records migrate with zero semantic retries rather than
receiving fabricated execution history. The journal uses full synchronous commits and a five-second lock
timeout, rejects symbolic-link final paths, and creates Unix files with `0600`
permissions. It is bounded to 10,000 records, 8 MiB per terminal step, 100
dispatch attempts, a five-minute maximum lease, and 64 MiB of total logical
payload including dispatch requests.

This is a durable continuation guarantee plus at-least-once dispatch. For
`runtime.refresh`, every redelivery reuses the same domain idempotency key, so
the current domain kernel commits the refresh once and replays its first result.
This is not a blanket exactly-once guarantee for arbitrary external adapters;
each future mutating effect must prove the same end-to-end contract.
Retention/compaction and deterministic structured merge remain Gate 2 work.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics use stable subsystem prefixes:

| Prefix | Owner | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LSE` | lexer and parser | malformed input, source limit |
| `LSH` | HIR and authorization | unknown effect, duplicate argument, missing capability |
| `LSV` | VM, continuation, and journal | invalid image, revision conflict, persistence failure |

Consumers must branch on diagnostic codes rather than English messages. Spans
use byte offsets into the original UTF-8 source.

## Integration Sequence

For deterministic model or CLI integration:

1. Parse source and report all syntax diagnostics.
2. Lower the syntax tree into HIR and report semantic diagnostics.
3. Authorize required capabilities before starting the VM.
4. Open the durable journal, then call `Vm::start`; pending state is committed before return.
5. Prefer `Vm::start_timed`, then call `Vm::claim_effect` using trusted scheduler time.
6. Call `Vm::acknowledge_effect` with the same lease and typed result before expiry.
7. Let expired leases become claimable after restart; never reuse an older attempt.
8. For commands, execute the persisted `CommandEnvelope` unchanged on every redelivery.
9. Treat repeated acknowledged completion as replay, not another external operation.
10. Treat `Cancelled` as a terminal result and never dispatch its operation again.
11. Report classified failures through `report_effect_error`; never retry outside the journal.

`Vm::resume` remains the direct embedded path for an effect that has not been
leased. Once a request is leased, completion must use `acknowledge_effect`.

The implementation lives in `crates/leselang-syntax`, `crates/leselang-hir`,
and `crates/leselang-vm`. Delivery progress is tracked by the
[project status tensor](project-status-system.md), not inferred from future
examples in architecture documents.
